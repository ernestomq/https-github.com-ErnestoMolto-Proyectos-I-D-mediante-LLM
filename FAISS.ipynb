This project combines approaches from the natural, engineering, and social sciences and the humanities (Science and Technology Studies) to understand how error correction in science works and what obstacles it faces, and stages events for scientists to reflect on error and overpromising.The projectâ\\x80\\x99s focus is nanobiology, a highly interdisciplinary field founded around the year 2000 that has already seen multiple episodes of overpromising and promotion of erroneous claims. We examine three such â\\x80\\x9cbubblesâ\\x80\\x9d: the claim that nanoparticles can cross the blood-brain barrier; that nanoparticles can penetrate the cell membrane; and the promotion of the â\\x80\\x9cprotein coronaâ\\x80\\x9d concept to describe ordinary adsorption of proteins on nanoparticles. Findings based on error (non)correction in nanobiology should be generalizable to other new, highly interdisciplinary fields such as synthetic biology and artificial intelligence.We trace claims and corrections in various'), Document(id='fc024c7d-282b-489c-9265-364d7f63bfd9', metadata={'row': '145156', 'grant agreement': '889546', 'project acronym': 'PROMISES', 'organisation PIC': '999898214', 'organisation name': 'UNIVERSIDAD DE ZARAGOZA', 'Small or Medium-sized Enterprise': 'False', 'organisation activity type': 'HES', 'organisation country': 'ES', 'organisation role': 'coordinator', 'funding for the organisation': '172932.48', 'organisation total participation cost': '172932.48', 'project title': 'Properties of nanomaterials made from misfit-layered compounds revealed by electron microscopy and simulations', 'project total cost': '172932.48', 'funding for the project': '172932.48', 'master call': 'H2020-MSCA-IF-2019', 'subcall': 'H2020-MSCA-IF-2019', 'type of proposal': 'MSCA-IF-EF-ST', 'project legal basis': 'H2020-EU.1.3.

To do this, I will tune the coupling between the island and the dot with a gate voltage and obtain the quantum phase diagram.While most of Majorana research is understandably focused on how to make a qubit, I will tackle three more fundamental questions, which will serve this purpose in the long run and go substantially beyond the state of the art. 1) How does a single quasiparticle in the island screen a spin? 2) How does screening occur when the island cannot accept quasiparticles? 3) Can novel non-Fermi liquid physics emerge when adding a superconducting lead to the dot-island system?')] \n",

The new paradigm will allow robots to acquire a large repertoire of flexible skills in conditions unforeseeable at design time with little human intervention, and then to exploit these skills to efficiently solve new user-defined tasks with no/little additional learning. This innovation will be essential in the design of future service robots addressing pressing societal needs. The project will develop the GOAL paradigm by pursuing three main objectives: (1) advance our understanding of how goals are formed and underlie skill learning in children; (2) develop innovative computational architectures and algorithms supporting (2a) the self-generation of useful goals based on user/task independent mechanisms such as intrinsic motivations, and (2b) the use'), Document(id='38a355a7-dba0-4507-876f-da1a8b70ea53', metadata={'row': '48602', 'grant agreement': '857339', 'project acronym': 'DEEPFIELD', 'organisation PIC': '999895983', 'organisation name': 'UNIVERSITAT DE GIRONA', 'Small or Medium-sized Enterprise': 'False', 'organisation activity type': 'HES', 'organisation country': 'ES', 'organisation role': 'participant', 'funding for the organisation': '122875.0', 'organisation total participation cost': '122875.0', 'project title': 'DeepField- Deep Learning in Field Robotics: from conceptualization towards implementation', 'project total cost': '799975.0', 'funding for the project': '799975.0', 'master call': 'H2020-WIDESPREAD-2018-2020', 'subcall': 'H2020-WIDESPREAD-2018-03', 'type of proposal': 'CSA', 'project legal basis': 'H2020-EU.4.b.

The mechanisms of corrosion propagation are fairly well understood, and various means of mitigation are known even if research is still necessary to improve this knowledge or to develop corrosion protection for the application of new materials. The vision of CIMNAS is that a major breakthrough for corrosion protection lies in a deep understanding and control of the initiation stage triggering corrosion. Corrosion initiation takes place at the atomic/molecular scale or at a scale of a few nanometres (the nanoscale) on metal and alloy surfaces, metallic, oxidised or coated, and interacting with the corroding environment. The mission of CIMNAS is to challenge the difficulty of understanding corrosion initiation at the nanometric/atomic scale on such complex interfaces, ultimately aiming at designing more robust metallic surfaces via the')] \n",

Corrosion is a multi-billion Euro problem for the oil and gas industry. Microbiologically-influenced corrosion (MIC) in this sector is usually linked to souring of oil fields due to production of toxic and corrosive H2S by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Injection of nitrate into sour oil fields is a bioengineering strategy, which removes H2S by promoting sulfide-oxidizing nitrate-reducing bacteria (soNRB). However, recent reports involved soNRB in MIC due to incomplete oxidation of H2S to corrosive sulfur intermediates. The end products of soNRB metabolism vary depending on the ratio of sulfide to nitrate.
