The aim of the project is to analyze the entire corpus of prophecies (in Latin or in vernacular, in prose or in verse), which is transmitted by a great variety of manuscripts (flyleaves, fliers, miscellanies) or included in larger texts (chronicles, sermons, encyclopedic works). This philological challenge will be the premise for a new and comprehensive interpretation of prophetic discourse as having a performative nature. In this perspective, the public sphere can be considered the lively theater in which civic identity was at the same time represented and created by prophecies: that is to say, texts which put into play not only ideas, but also strong emotions such as love and hate, hope and fear. The project proposes an unprecedented dialogue between material philology, media studies and history of emotions.

Analysis of a group of mainly poetic texts, selected on the basis of their references to baptism and water, will help determine how these topics are treated and developed in relation to salvation. The texts will also be studied with reference to their codicological context to reconsider the individual manuscripts as a whole and re-evaluate the criteria in the composition of the codices, and the different meaning these topics assume with regard to different contexts. Texts referencing water will be compared to show similarities and differences in the treatment of baptism, and linguistic patterns will be established.

If this gap in the knowledge is filled, we could learn to distinguish between subgap states related to screening of the dot, and those involving the island/nanowire hybrid. Crucially, only the latter ones are related to Majorana modes.At QDev, I will investigate screening by an epitaxial superconducting Al island of a single quantum dot defined in an InAs nanowire. To do this, I will tune the coupling between the island and the dot with a gate voltage and obtain the quantum phase diagram.While most of Majorana research is understandably focused on how to make a qubit, I will tackle three more fundamental questions, which will serve this purpose in the long run and go substantially beyond the state of the art. 1) How does a single quasiparticle in the island screen a spin? 2) How does screening occur when the island cannot accept quasiparticles? 3) Can novel non-Fermi liquid physics emerge when adding a superconducting lead to the dot-island system?')] \n",

This philological challenge will be the premise for a new and comprehensive interpretation of prophetic discourse as having a performative nature. In this perspective, the public sphere can be considered the lively theater in which civic identity was at the same time represented and created by prophecies: that is to say, texts which put into play not only ideas, but also strong emotions such as love and hate, hope and fear.

The first aim will be achieved by making an in-depth search in catalogues and directly in convent libraries of Castile and other institutions with keep collections related with female monasticism.

This urgently calls for new, cost-effective corrosion mitigation strategies to prolong the useful life of ageing civil infrastructures. Electrochemical corrosion protection (ECP) methods have a large potential to play a key role in addressing this challenge.

The mechanisms of corrosion propagation are fairly well understood, and various means of mitigation are known even if research is still necessary to improve this knowledge or to develop corrosion protection for the application of new materials. The vision of CIMNAS is that a major breakthrough for corrosion protection lies in a deep understanding and control of the initiation stage triggering corrosion. Corrosion initiation takes place at the atomic/molecular scale or at a scale of a few nanometres (the nanoscale) on metal and alloy surfaces, metallic, oxidised or coated, and interacting with the corroding environment. The mission of CIMNAS is to challenge the difficulty of understanding corrosion initiation at the nanometric/atomic scale on such complex interfaces, ultimately aiming at designing more robust metallic surfaces via the')] \n",

Microbiologically-influenced corrosion (MIC) in this sector is usually linked to souring of oil fields due to production of toxic and corrosive H2S by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB).

The purpose of the VISUAL project is to take the field a step further through the development of an innovative and original typology for the visual politics of recognition.

This will be reached using different integrated methodologies such as the organisation of a large set of training and brokerage workshops and services and the development of a Digital Platform, which will perform in an interoperable manner with ongoing platforms and initiatives (e.g. the European Network for Pilot Production Facilities and Innovation Hubs, the European Material Modelling Council etc.). To promote international cooperation SUSNANOFAB Consortium includes 3 US partners not requesting EU funding. To involve high number of key actors, the project has already achieved the support of several companies, research and education')] \n",
